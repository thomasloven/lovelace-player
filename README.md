lovelace-player
===============

# This is deprecated - Use [browser_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) instead

Use any browser currently viewing your lovelace interface as an audio receiver with a `media_player` interface.

Example use case: An iPad mounted to your wall as a home automation dashboard can now receive text-to-speech announcements from home-assistant.

# Breaking changes!
Lovelace-player configuration has recently changed entirely.
See below for setup instructions.

# Installation instructions

This plugin requires [card-tools](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-tools) to be installed.

For installation instructions [see this guide](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins).

The recommended type of this plugin is: `js`.

After installing the plugin, you also need to install the `floorplan_speaker` media player component.

Download `floorplan_speaker.py` from [pkozul/ha-floorplan-kiosk](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan-kiosk) and save to `<ha config>/custom_components/floorplan_speaker/media_player.py`.

Also create an empty file at `<ha config>/custom_components/floorplan_speaker/__init__.py`. (That's two underscores on each side of `init`)

# Usage instructions

First, you need to add a media player to your home assistant configuration, which your lovelace interface will connect to.

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: floorplan_speaker
    name: my_floorplan_speaker
```

The connection is then setup in the resources section (where you imported `lovelace-player.js` to your lovelace configuration, by adding one or more variables on the form `<entity-id>=<device-id>` to the script URL:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/card-tools.js
    type: js
  - url: /local/lovelace-player.js?<entity-id>=<device-id>
    type: js
```

`<entity-id>` is the entity id of your `media_player`, e.g. `media_player.my_floorplan_speaker`.

`<device-id>` is the device ID for your device-browser combination (see below).

To add more players, you add more `<entity-id>=<device-id>` combinations to the url, separated by an ampersand `&`.


## About device IDs

The Device ID is a random number that is generated the first time you view the lovelace UI in a new browser after installing `card-tools`. It is stored in your browsers localStorage and *can not* be accessed or used to identify your browser by any other website (this is not true for Fully Kiosk browser for Android).

To get your Deice ID, the easiest method is to look in your browser console (press F12 in google Chrome, most browsers have something similar). There you should be able to see a message saying "CARD-TOOLS IS INSTALLED" followed by your Device ID.

If you don't have access to the console (e.g. on a mobile browser), you can add the variable `getID=true` to the script URL. You should then get a popup displaying your Device ID the next time you reload your lovelace interface.
